In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept othersâ€™ requests as well.

Table request_accepted holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.

requester_id	accepter_id	accept_date
1	                2	        2016_06-03
1	                3	        2016-06-08
2	                3	        2016-06-08
3	                4	        2016-06-09
Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number. For the sample data above, the result is:

id	num
3	   3

SELECT TOP 1 requester_id AS 'id',SUM(total_friends) AS 'num'
FROM
(SELECT requester_id,
CASE WHEN accepter_id!=0 THEN 1
ELSE 0
END AS 'total_friends'
FROM
requested_accepted
UNION ALL
SELECT accepter_id,
CASE WHEN requester_id!=0 THEN 1
ELSE 0
END AS 'total_friends'
FROM
requested_accepted) a
GROUP BY requester_id
ORDER BY SUM(total_friends) DESC
