Write an SQL query to find the most recent 3 orders of each user. If a user ordered less than 3 orders return all of their orders.
Return the result table sorted by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by the order_date in descending order.
The query result format is in the following example:
Customers
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+
Orders
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |
